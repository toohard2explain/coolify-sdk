```typescript
import { coolify } from 'coolify-typescript-sdk';

const token = process.env.COOLIFY_API_TOKEN; // set your token in the environment variables (recommended)

// or
// const token = "token123!";

const client = coolify(token, {
    host: "coolify.mydomain.co",
    secure: true // if https is used
});
```
